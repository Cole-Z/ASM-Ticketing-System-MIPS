### Final Project: Asm ticketing program

## Description

This is a simple ticketing system. User/User's will enter their 'age' and a ticket price will be generated. 

# ticket prices
Adult: $10.00
Child/Youth: $9.00
Seniors: $8.50 (15% off Adult price)

Something to note, if only children or youth ages are entered, such as 16, 17, 15, then an additional 'Adult ticket' will be added to the total since children cannot attend without an adult.
