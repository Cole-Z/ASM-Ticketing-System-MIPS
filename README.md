# Final Project: Asm ticketing program

## Description

This is a simple ticketing system. User/User's will enter their 'age' and a ticket price will be generated. 

### ticket prices
Adult: $10.00
Child/Youth: $9.00
Seniors: $8.50 (15% off Adult price)

Something to note, if only children or youth ages are entered, such as 16, 17, 15, then an additional 'Adult ticket' will be added to the total since children cannot attend without an adult.

### Functionality

Enter one age at a time to keep while loop running.

To exit the ticketing system, enter '-1' to exit the loop and print the total price.
